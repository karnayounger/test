## Journalism open textbook for undergraduates
# Welcome!
Thanks for learning more about our conspiracy to save some undergraduate journalists a few bucks on books!  

### What we are up to
We are spearheading the creation of an open textbook for an undergraduate journalism course on research methods. Open textbooks are part of the open access movement, which advocates for information to be freely and easily accessible to all. For us, this means that we are collaborating with a number of our colleagues to create a textbook that will be free of cost to students. We plan to create it using software that will allow students to read the text on their laptops, on their phones, in their cars, on the beach, in a boat, or wherever the mood strikes them to study for class. If students don't like purusing books online, they can easily download and print it, write and highlight all over it, and even cover it with stickers. 

Check out our [roadmap](roadmap.md) for our production schedule and more topic ideas. 

### Who do we need? You. 

The purpose of the book is to prepare future journalists to research, so we need journalists, librarians, and related smart people to help us author the textbook. Chapter authors may submit a proposal on topics such as interviewing, government information (federal, state, local, and hyper-local),topic or source development, the structuring of information, and the list goes on.
