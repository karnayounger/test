## Journalism open textbook for undergraduates
# Welcome!
Are you a journalist, librarian, or smarty-pants willing to author chapters for our research methodology textbook for undergraduate journalists? Come on in.  

### What we are up to?

Using your know-how, we are fashioning an open textbook for an undergraduate journalism course on research methods. Open textbooks are part of the open access movement, which advocates for information to be freely and easily accessible to all. So we are collaborating to write a free text that students can access on their laptops, on their phones, in their cars, on the beach, in a boat, or wherever the mood strikes them to study for class. If students don't like purusing books online, they can easily download, print, and smother it with stickers. 

Check out our [roadmap](roadmap.md) for our production schedule and more topic ideas. 

### Who do we need? You. 
If you are a journalist, librarian, or awesome, help us. Submit a proposal on interviewing, government information (federal, state, local, and hyper-local),topic or source development, the structuring of knowledge.
